Evil Hangman project for CSC 2053

## From the assignment prompt:

> Evil Hangman is a popular homework assignment thought up by Professor Keith Schwarz of
Stanford University.

> “Evil Hangman is an assignment in which students write a computer program that cheats at the
classic game Hangman. Normally, when programming a computer to play Hangman, the
computer picks a single word and accurately represents it as the human player tries to guess all
of the letters in the word. In Evil Hangman, the computer instead maintains a list of every word
in the English language, then continuously pares down the word list to try to dodge the player's
guesses as much as possible. Human players tend to fare terribly against this conniving silicon
foe!”
